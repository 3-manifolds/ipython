long_description = IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most out of using Python
    interactively.  Its main components are:

    * A powerful interactive Python shell
    * A `Jupyter <https://jupyter.org/>`_ kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter
    notebooks and other interactive frontends.

    The enhanced interactive Python shells have the following main features:

    * Comprehensive object introspection.

    * Input history, persistent across sessions.

    * Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated
    references.

    * Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python
    variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.

    * Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and
    performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.

    * A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups
    (simpler than changing $PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).

    * Session logging and reloading.

    * Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.

    * Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.

    * Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.

    * Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.

    The latest development version is always available from IPython's `GitHub
    site <http://github.com/ipython>`_.
